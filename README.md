# CameraCalibrations

This is a package for camera calibration in Julia.

## How to install
```julia
] add CameraCalibrations
```

## How to use
First we build the calibration object based on the `files`: the image files of the checkerboard, `n_corners`: the number of inner corners in each of the sides of the checkerboard, and `checker_size`: the physical size of the checker (e.g. in cm).


```julia
using CameraCalibrations
c = fit(files, n_corners, checker_size)
```

Then we can use that object to calibrate pixel coordinates and/or images, given the extrinsic image we want to refer to:
```julia
i1 = RowCol(1.2, 3.4) # a cartesian index in image-pixel coordinates
xyz = c(i1, 1) # convert to real-world coordinates of the first image
i2 = c(xyz, 1) # convert back to pixel coordinates
i2 â‰ˆ i1 # true
```

## Features

[x] corner detection is done with opencv
[x] model fitting is done with opencv
[x] opencv is python-free
